# AI within one’s own discipline and teaching practice

**Learning outcome:**
- To be able to relate AI to one's own discipline and teaching practice.

**Keywords:**
Subject-specific AI, subject-didactic AI applications

## Information about the module
A variety of fields are influenced to some extent by advances in AI. This includes not only changes to professional practice as new subject-specific AI applications are developed, but also the broader impact of general AI, such as generative AI, on one’s discipline. To prepare students for their future careers, it is essential that education programs address current issues around subject-specific AI.

In addition to covering subject-specific AI within educational programs, there is also a need to explore how AI can support subject-specific teaching. Here, a more subject-didactic approach becomes relevant, looking at how teaching should be designed based on the specific needs and conditions of each subject. Given the rapid pace of change, it may also be beneficial to consider how AI applications can be integrated into subject-specific teaching to deal with subject-didactic challenges or enable alternative teaching strategies.

The purpose of this module is to identify how AI is used in the participant’s field of study and to consider its impact on their teaching practice. While some aspects may overlap between fields, or that generative AI may be more generally relevant, most of this work needs to be conducted within each specific discipline. Therefore, these activities should be carried out in homogenous groups based on specific subject areas.

The module is divided into two parts. The first part addresses AI applications within the participants' fields of study, where they will engage in activities aimed at initiating a developmental work. The second part focuses on the impact of AI on one’s teaching practice, largely based on discussions and exchange of experiences.

## Part 1 – Identifying AI applications within one’s field of study (2 hours)

### Step 1, watch video (15 min)
*Participants begin by watching a video individually, which provides background information and examples of AI applications across different fields.*

**Participant instructions:**
In this activity, you will watch [a video that introduces subject-specific AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ypm2NwD9XVU) and provides several application examples. This will give you a foundation for working through the next steps.

### Step 2, identify AI applications (45 min)
*Participants work in pairs to identify AI applications within their own field of study.*

**Participant instructions:**
This activity involves identifying AI applications within your own field. Work in pairs with someone from the same discipline, and search for examples of AI applications, either through online research or by consulting colleagues. Compile a brief summary of the examples you find, ranking them based on their relevance to your courses. This documentation will be used for further development work.

### Step 3, begin development work (60 min)
*Participants work in groups of 4-6 people to start integrating content into existing or new courses.*

**Participant instructions:**
In this final step, you will work in groups, based on the work from the previous steps, to develop more concrete content related to subject-specific AI in existing or new courses. The goal is not to finalize content but to begin a development process. Focus on formulating learning objectives, considering potential assessments, and discussing possible teaching activities and formats. Ensure that one person in the group documents the work so it can continue after the activity.

## Part 2 – Discussion on teaching practice (2 hours)

### Step 1, watch video and reflect (15 + 15 min)
*Participants start by watching a video introducing the TPACK model, which provides a perspective on the role of technologies in subject-specific teaching. They then reflect individually on their teaching practice, focusing on the most challenging areas to teach, given their subject's unique needs.*

**Participant instructions:**
Watch a [video introducing the TPACK framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24HYMy000Ro), along with examples of AI applications in subject-specific teaching. This will serve as a basis for the discussion in Step 2.

After watching the video, reflect on the areas you find most challenging to teach. Focus on the challenges specific to your subject area. Write down the areas you identify as challenging and provide a brief explanation of why they pose difficulties.

### Step 2, discuss and share experiences on AI in teaching practice with a subject-didactic focus (1 hour 30 min)
*Participants discuss the potential use of AI in their teaching practice, focusing on subject-didactic needs and conditions.*

**Participant instructions:**
In this step, discuss with your group how AI might be used in your teaching practice with a subject-specific focus. This involves focusing on subject-didactic questions, or aspects of subject-specific teaching tailored to the needs of the content and characteristics of the subject. While generative AI can be a starting point, it is essential not to limit the discussion to this. Topics like learning analytics or more subject-specific AI are also relevant. Use the following questions as guidance:

1. What potential uses of AI can we identify in our specific teaching practice?
2. What opportunities and challenges might we face when using AI in teaching?
3. Are there subject-specific needs or requirements we must consider?
4. Are there other factors to consider, such as legal or ethical aspects?
5. What competencies are necessary to teach this content, and how do we ensure that everyone has the opportunity to develop them?
