# WASP-ED
## Resources for developing competence training for university lecturers (without specialized knowledge in AI)

**[Module 1: Introduction](https://github.com/wasp-ed/moduler/blob/main/modul1.en.md)**

**[Module 3: Ethics, possibilities and risks](https://github.com/wasp-ed/moduler/blob/main/modul3.en.md)**

**[Module 4: Generative AI and Learning Analytics en education](https://github.com/wasp-ed/moduler/blob/main/modul4..en.md)**

**[Module 5: AI in one's own subject area and teaching practice](https://github.com/wasp-ed/moduler/blob/main/modul5.en.md)**

The target group for the modules is teachers in higher education, and they are intended to be used by teachers themselves as a basis for competence development within their own workgroup, or by educational developers as material for competence development workshops or higher education pedagogy courses for teachers. The modules can be used in their entirety or in parts, or alternatively as inspiration to create your own material.

The instructions in the modules are written for the facilitator who will lead the delivery of the module. The facilitator needs to consider which parts of the material should be made available to the participants as preparation in advance and which parts should perhaps only be revealed to the participants during the group session. The facilitator is responsible for distributing both the preparatory material and the instructions to the participants.
