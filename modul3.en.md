# Ethics, opportunities and risks


Learning outcome:

- Reflect on ethical aspects
- Evaluate the potential opportunities and risks of using AI

Keywords:

Algorithmic discrimination, bias, surveillance, data storage, GDPR, integrity, power, monopoly, cheating

Information about the module:

This module is intended to be completed in two stages. The participants must first prepare individually (1 h) and then participate in a joint physical meeting with the other participants (2 h). Make sure that materials and questions for the preparation are available to the participants during the preparation time. The joint meeting is led by a facilitator. At that time, the participants need to have access to some digital device (computer, mobile, etc.) Total time required for both preparation and implementation is supposed to be 3 hours.

**Individual reflection:**

Reflect on the content above. Is there any ethical aspect that you think is particularly important? What do we want to use AI for? When is it appropriate to use AI?

---

_Joint physical meeting all participants + facilitator (2 h)._

**Practical work (60 min):**

_Recommended to be carried out in smaller groups of 3–4 participants. The facilitator moves between the groups and makes sure everyone gets started._

1. Invent and describe any application of AI that in your opinion would be inappropriate from an ethical perspective! Start from one or more of the key concepts for this module. Allow yourself to be a little dystopian and describe in as much detail as possible. Explain clearly why your application is inappropriate.
2. Generative AI uses machine learning where a model is trained on data that you want to teach the model to create. Recently, we have seen how several services have popped up that can generate both text, images and music. The training data is almost always collected via the internet by large companies such as Google or Microsoft, where millions of users have contributed data without compensation. Services based on these models are then resold on a subscription basis to those who can afford it. Imagine if it were different. Describe a scenario where generative AI can be developed in a different direction and used in an ethical way to help all people solve some of the global problems and challenges we face!
3. Search among news articles on the Internet for at least three examples of how AI is used to monitor the people in states that are more or less authoritarian. Help each other in the group to be critical of sources and feel free to double-check the information you find against several sources!

**\
Break (15 min)**

**Joint reflection/discussion (45 min):**

_Suggested to be carried out in slightly larger groups where several of the smaller groups have been combined, alternatively with all participants. The facilitator directs the conversation._

Part I: The societal benefit of AI

- Briefly discuss each group's inappropriate applications of AI.
- What do we want to use AI for? When is it appropriate to use AI?

\
Part II: AI in Higher Education

One of the tasks you worked on before the break is about generative AI. An example of generative AI is the ChatGPT service which was launched at the end of 2022 by the research company OpenAI and which is partially funded by Microsoft. Now Microsoft has already begun to integrate generative AI into some of its services and plans to continue doing so in the future.

- Where is the line drawn to cheating when generative AI is used in studies and research?
- When is it appropriate to use AI in higher education?
