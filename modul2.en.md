# Module 2 - Practical work

**Learning outcome:**  
- Basic understanding of how AI works
- Conceptual understanding

**Keywords:**  
Machine learning, Deep learning, Neural network, Training data

## Information about the module

This module is designed to be completed in two steps. Participants will first explore two different examples of AI applications through accompanying video introductions. They will then participate in a group session where they will train a neural network using an online service and engage in a discussion led by a facilitator. Activities require access to a computer. The total time estimated is 2.5-3 hours (1.5 hours individually and 1-1.5 hours in a group setting).

## Part 1 - Individual exploration of AI applications (1 hour and 30 minutes)

### Step 1, exploring Deep learning (30 minutes)

*Participants begin by watching a video that introduces an example in MATLAB, which they will then work with. They will explore the environment and example, experimenting with parameters or sources as needed. The environment includes instructions to enable self-testing.*

**Participant instructions:**

This activity involves exploring deep learning using the MATLAB programming environment with simple, practical code. The example is based on image recognition. You have the opportunity to experiment with both code and the source for analysis. Don't hesitate to experiment—if something goes wrong, simply reload the page.

- Start by watching the video [Explore deep learning with MATLAB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELIcLRsX_wQ)
- Then, go to the [MATLAB programming environment](https://se.mathworks.com/campaigns/offers/deep-learning-try-in-browser.html#) and click on "Launch the example". 
- Review the code and experiment, for instance, by adjusting the image source for analysis. Return to the video if needed.
- Reload the page if you encounter issues or want to reset everything and try again.

### Step 2, Prompting Large Language Models (60 minutes)

*Participants begin by watching a video introducing language models and prompting. They then choose at least one of the specified services to explore different types of prompts within given guidelines. This step ends with a short group reflection on prompting using several discussion questions.*

**Participant instructions:**

In this activity, you will explore various ways to formulate prompts (essentially instructions) for a language model. Several online services are available for free, though some may require login. Begin by watching the video [Introduction to large language models and prompting](https://youtu.be/npZ-khffSoQ).

Next, explore at least one of the following chatbots:

- ChatGPT ([https://chatgpt.com/](https://chatgpt.com/)), a chatbot from OpenAI using the GPT language model.
- Copilot ([https://copilot.microsoft.com/](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)), a chatbot from Microsoft also based on OpenAI’s language model, with slightly different output.
- Claude ([https://claude.ai/](https://claude.ai/)), a chatbot from Anthropic using the Claude language model.
- Gemini ([https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/)), a chatbot from Google using the Gemini language model.

Follow these instructions while exploring the chatbots:

- Start with a simple prompt, asking the chatbot to create a short text within an area you are familiar with. Then ask the chatbot to rephrase it according to a specific instruction, such as adjusting style or tone.
- Next, ask the same request from the chatbot but include initial instructions in the prompt for text style, tone, or level of detail. Make a few more prompts, asking for specific changes or improvements in the result.
- Finally, repeat the request, but this time provide an example text as a model for the desired output.
- Reflect on why the results vary and how it affects how you might work with language models for different purposes.
- If time allows, try repeating the above steps with a different chatbot.

Conclude by discussing your experiences from the above exercise with the group. Reflect on the following questions:

- How did the result vary depending on the different ways of prompting?
- Why do you think the results vary?
- How might you need to adapt your prompting based on different purposes and needs?

## Part 2 - Group activity, training a Neural Network (1-1.5 hours)

*Before the session, participants prepare by watching an introduction to Google Teachable Machine, which they will then work with. During the session, they work in pairs to train a neural network using this tool. The activity is followed by a group discussion, led by a facilitator. The questions to be addressed are listed in the description below. Terms from Module 1 should be used in the discussion.*

**Participant instructions:**

This activity lets you build neural networks using Google’s Teachable Machine. It allows you to train a network to recognize different objects, sounds, or body positions using a relatively simple visual interface. Once you have created a "model," you can even export it for use on a website or on your computer to trigger events, like playing a sound when someone smiles at a webcam. The activity is conducted on-site, but please prepare by watching the video below.

- Begin by watching the video [Try the Google Teachable machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5SE5_MpBiw) before coming to the session.
- At the session, you will work in pairs to complete the task.
- Go to [Google Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
- Try training the network with different things, such as people, objects, or similar items.
- With guidance from the facilitator, reflect on and discuss what happens within the tool, addressing questions such as:
  - Why does the result turn out the way it does?
  - Why does the tool react as it does?
  - What is the tool learning when it is trained?
  - Use relevant terms from Module 1 in the discussion.
