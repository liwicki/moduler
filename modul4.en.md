**Keywords**:
- Learning Analytics, Generative AI

# Information about the module

The latest generative AI tools are often user-friendly, encompassing everything from image creation programs to text and code generation, and do not require any special technical skills to be used. Digital aids such as spell checking, auto-generated text suggestions, and the ability to listen to text-based content have revolutionized the way we work with information and compensate for our shortcomings. Generative AI has become such a natural part of our daily lives that we no longer reflect on what thought processes they support and how it affects our knowledge, as well as what and how we learn.

**The aim** of this module is to identify generative AI and Learning Analytics as aids in studies and teaching practice and to provide inspiration to develop the use of these to take advantage of the opportunities of digitalization for increased and improved learning among our students.

To create the conditions for this, the module contains two parts: one part that deals with describing and reflecting on and developing the use of generative AI as an aid in teaching and a second part that provides a basis for reflecting on and developing the use of Learning Analytics in teaching practice. Both part 1 and part 2 contain two exercises each and one of the tasks in each part is a practical exercise. It is possible to choose to do only a practical exercise because there are exciting opportunities in combining the use of generative AI with Learning Analytics.

# Part 1 How can we understand and use generative AI in teaching practice?

Based on how we understand generative AI as an aid, we need to ask ourselves a number of questions in our teaching practice. We need to think about what knowledge is in relation to assistive devices and what the assistive devices can support us to do. We also need to think about how we value knowledge in relation to the tools we have available â€“ what is important to know and what knowledge is perceived as less relevant or even dated. Another aspect to consider is whether and if so, when assistive devices risk hindering learning or even causing us to lose knowledge, and if so, what risks this entails.

## Reflective discussion film 1

### Instructions for participants

Create groups with about 6 participants in each group. Appoint a _chairperson_ and an _observer_ in each group.

The _chairperson_ keeps track of the time and that the questions, as well as all participants, are given space in the discussion.

The _Observer_ documents the discussion that is taking place and is expected to reproduce and summarize the discussion in the next step.

**1\.       Take 3 minutes per question to individually and quietly reflect on:**

a) How does access to assistive technology such as generative AI affect how we value knowledge and how we view learning?

b) What knowledge will be relevant and possible to test in relation to generative AI?

**2\.       Discuss the questions in the divided groups for 20 minutes.**

The chairperson keeps track of the time and, if necessary, distributes the floor between the participants and the time between questions. The observer documents the discussion based on the following aspects:

- How does the discussion flow?
- Are there any thresholds in the discussion and if so, what were they?
- What particularly interesting posts are noted?

**3\.       Summarize the discussion individually (3 minutes)**

All participants prepare to summarize in one minute the most important insights they take away from the discussion.

The observer prepares to summarize in 3 minutes the discussion as a whole based on the following aspects:

- How did the discussion flow?
- Were there any thresholds in the discussion and if so, what were they?
- What particularly interesting posts are noted?

**4\.       Summarize the discussion in group (6 x 3 minutes)**

The Chairperson allows each participant to reproduce their summary for one minute each and finally gives the observer the last 3 minutes to reproduce their summary.

## Practical exercise film 2

**(Estimated time required: individual preparatory work approx. 1.5 h plus implementation, group discussion approx. 1 h and 15 min)**

#### **Please note that the practical exercise lasts over a longer period, for example one or two weeks.**

Generative AI can be used for several purposes in teaching practice and by both you as a teacher and by our students in their learning. This exercise is about you as a teacher first reflecting on some questions regarding the use of generative AI and then identifying a way that you can use generative AI in your own teaching practice. The exercise takes place in four steps (1) watch the film and reflect on the questions, (2) identify and plan for how you can use generative AI in your teaching (3) carry out your planning in your own practice (4) present and evaluate your practical element in your teaching group

### Instructions for participants

Create groups with about 6 participants in each group. Appoint a _chairperson_ and an observer_ in each group. The groups are first used in point 4 of the instructions below, but it is important that the groups and the division of roles are appointed in advance. It can preferably be the same groups, but a different distribution of roles, as in the discussion based on film 1.

The _chairperson_ keeps track of the time and that the questions, as well as all participants, are given space in the discussion.

The _Observer_ documents the discussion that is taking place and is expected to reproduce and summarize the discussion in the next step.

**1\.       Individual preparation: Watch the film and reflect (10 + 10 min)**

Based on the thoughts presented in the film, reflect on:

a) How and for what can we use generative AI to contribute to a positive knowledge development of our students by improving and facilitating learning?

b) What do we as teachers need to consider when using generative AI and Learning Analytics in our teaching practice?

**2\.       Individual work: Identify and plan (40 min)**

Identify a use case for generative AI that you want to try in your teaching practice. Plan for the _how_, to _what_, and _when_ to use generative AI.

**3\.       Individual work: Implementation**

Carry out the use you have planned for. During the implementation, you will consider:

- What opportunities does the way you have chosen to use generative AI in your teaching practice create?
- What challenges does the way you have chosen to use generative AI in your teaching practice pose?

Prepare a 7-minute presentation and evaluation of how you used generative AI based on the points:

Presentation:

- _What_ did you use generative AI for?
- _Why_, for what purpose did you use it?
- _When_ (at what time(s), for how long, how many times, etc.) did you use generative AI?

Evaluation:

- What _opportunities_ did you identify that generative AI created based on how you used it?
- What _challenges_ did you encounter based on how you used generative AI?

**4\.       Group work: Presentation, evaluation and discussion (approx. 1 h and 15 min)**\
The _Chairperson_ allows each participant to present their practical implementation and the opportunities and challenges identified during the work for 7 minutes. When all participants have presented their individual exercises, the chairman gives room for discussion (about 20 minutes).

The _Observer_ documents the presentations and the discussion that takes place based on the questions:

- What opportunities are identified that generative AI can create in a teaching practice?
- What challenges do we need to consider in the work with generative AI are identified?
